# One Click JavaScript Toggle

*a fork of Quick Javascript Switcher*

**One Click JavaScript Toggle (OJT)** is a Chrome Extension to enable/disable JavaScript as quickly as possible.  

This is a fork of the amazing [Quick JavaScript Switcher][qjs] by Maxime Le Breton, which unfortunately seems abandoned. The goal of OJT is to fix up some bugs
in OJT as well as add some minor features.

## Features
* Disable JavaScript immediately for the current page via browser button or right click menu.
* Quickly access JavaScript settings.
* Easily view pages that have JavaScript disabled.

## How to install

The easiest way is to install is from the [Chrome Web Store][webstore].

### Manual Install

Alternatively, you can [download the .zip extension][zip-extension], go to the [Extensions page][chrome-extensions], open the Developer mode, and click on "Load unpacked extension".  
Find the extension folder, and press OK.
